## Especially sensitive use cases

There are topics where extra caution is needed:

- Physical health.  
- Mental health.  
- Children and teenagers.  
- Money and investments.  
- Legal questions.

### Why this matters

- The potential harm from mistakes is higher.  
- The AI does not know your full context (country, laws, systems, personal history).  
- It cannot take responsibility – you can.

### How to use AI carefully in these areas

Use AI mainly for:
- explanations,  
- organizing your own thoughts,  
- suggesting questions you might want to ask a human professional.

Do **not** use it to:
- diagnose,  
- make treatment or legal decisions,  
- promise outcomes.
