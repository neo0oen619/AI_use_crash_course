## Privacy – what not to send to AI

### Basic principle

If you would not be comfortable seeing the information on a public notice board,  
do **not** paste it into an AI chat, unless you truly understand and accept the privacy policy and legal context.

### Examples of sensitive data

- Full names, addresses, phone numbers, ID numbers.  
- Identifiable health or mental health details.  
- Bank and credit card information.  
- Sensitive business or research secrets.

### Simple anonymization

If you need to discuss a case:
- replace names (“Person A”, “client”, “participant”),  
- blur identifying details (workplace, city, exact date),  
- focus on the **general question**, not the specifics that reveal someone.

### Short exercise

Take a real or imaginary story and:
1. Write it fully for yourself (do not send it).  
2. Write an anonymized version that you would feel okay sharing with AI.  

Then ask AI:

> “Does this text look anonymous enough, or are there still sensitive details I should remove?”
