## DO / DON’T checklist – ethics and privacy

### DO

- Use AI for writing, summarizing, and organizing your thoughts.  
- Keep information anonymous when possible.  
- Document important decisions and who made them.  
- Remind yourself regularly of the tool’s limitations.

### DON’T

- Don’t paste identifying details without a strong reason and proper permission.  
- Don’t make serious decisions based on one AI answer.  
- Don’t present AI output as a final “diagnosis” or “verdict”.

### When working with other people

- Consider if and how to tell them you are using AI.  
- Don’t create the impression that everything is hand‑written if it isn’t.  
- Respect people who prefer that AI not be used in the process with them.
