## Responsibility and roles – who does what?

### The AI’s role

- Offer ideas.  
- Help with wording and summarizing.  
- Assist in learning and understanding complex ideas.

### Your role

- Decide what to adopt and what to ignore.  
- Check important points using other sources.  
- Take responsibility for real‑world decisions.

### Keeping perspective

- If an answer is dramatic, pause and double‑check.  
- If an answer is very reassuring, remember the AI does not see the full picture.

You can ask the AI:

> “At the end of your answer, list 2–3 limitations of what you just wrote – who it may **not** be suitable for, and what you don’t know.”
