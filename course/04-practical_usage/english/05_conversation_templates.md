## Conversation templates – managing a good talk with AI

In this module you already saw how to use AI in daily life and how to debug answers.  
Here we focus on the **structure of the conversation itself** – how to manage it so it really helps you.

The idea: instead of just throwing questions at the model, build a **path**:
- clear opening,  
- working in stages,  
- pause points and summaries,  
- “heavy debug” when things go sideways,  
- and a closing that turns the chat into something you can use.

### 1. Opening a conversation – who I am, what the goal is, how we’ll work

Basic template:

> “You are [role of the AI].  
> I am [who I am, briefly].  
> My goal in this conversation is [goal].  
> Let’s work in stages: first [step 1], then [step 2], then [step 3].  
> Whenever I write ‘summary please’ – you will summarize what we’ve done so far.”

Example:

> “You are a thinking partner who helps me see things I might be missing.  
> I’m a student/researcher who feels a bit overloaded with everything.  
> My goal is to make sense of my tasks and thoughts.  
> First we’ll list and organize what’s on my plate, then we’ll think creatively about options, and in the end we’ll summarize next steps.”

### 2. Structure of a good message – expressing yourself clearly

For longer messages, it helps to follow this pattern:

1. **Short statement of the goal** – “I want to understand / solve / organize…”.  
2. **Relevant context only** – not your whole life story, just what matters.  
3. **What you already tried** – so you don’t get the same suggestions again.  
4. **What you want now** – ideas? structure? summary? critique? plan?

Template:

> “Goal: [what I want to get].  
> Short context: [2–4 sentences].  
> What I’ve already tried:  
> – …  
> – …  
> What I’m asking for now: [type of help].”

This helps both the AI and your own thinking.

### 3. Pause points – summary, check, adjust

In conversations longer than a few messages, it’s useful to stop and ask:

- Are we still moving toward my goal?  
- Does the AI understand what I’m trying to do?  
- What am I missing?

Useful prompts:

> “Please summarize in 5 bullet points what we’ve done so far and what you think my goal is.”  
>  
> “What do you think is missing from my description so far for you to help me better?”  
>  
> “If you had to guess, what am I **not** paying enough attention to in this problem?”

This is where **creative thinking** comes in – not just taking answers, but asking:
What am I **not** seeing? Where might my blind spots be?

### 4. “Heavy debug” – when the conversation goes off‑track

If you feel that the chat is:
- drifting,  
- repeating itself,  
- or just not helping –

You can pause and say:

> “Stop for a moment.  
> Summarize what you think my goal is and what you’ve done so far.  
> Then write where you think we went off‑track – what we haven’t tried, or what is missing from the way the problem is defined.”

You can also ask:

> “Give me three different directions we could take from here:  
> – Direction 1: improve the structure of what we did.  
> – Direction 2: think more creatively and get out of the box.  
> – Direction 3: simplify and reduce the scope.”

Then pick the direction that feels right.

### 5. Regularly asking “What am I missing?”

This is a healthy question to ask in many conversations:

> “What am I probably **missing** here?  
> What information did I not give, or what perspective did I not mention?”

And a complementary one:

> “What three questions would you ask me to understand this problem better?”

This makes the conversation more two‑way, and opens room for “out‑of‑the‑box” angles.

---

### 6. Closing a conversation – closing the loop

Before ending a conversation, you can ask:

> “Please summarize what we did in this conversation in 7–10 bullet points,  
> and then write:  
> – one recommended next step for me,  
> – and a version of the key points that I can paste into my notes file.”

Or:

> “Write a short letter from ‘future me’ to ‘present me’  
> that summarizes the most important things we reached in this chat.”

This turns the chat from “some messages” into organized knowledge you can reuse later.
