## Daily workflows with AI

The goal here is to show how AI can fit into your day in a simple way.

### 1. Start of the day – quick planning

> “Today I need to do:  
> – …  
> – …  
> I have about [X] free hours.  
> Please help me plan my day and mark where you as an AI can help me (summaries, drafting, ideas).”

The AI can:
- suggest a reasonable order for your tasks,  
- suggest where to use it (e.g., drafting an email, summarizing a text).

### 2. During the day – writing and editing

> “I want to write an email / message / short summary about [topic].  
> Here are my main points:  
> – …  
> – …  
> Please turn this into a short, clear, polite text.”

### 3. End of the day – reflection and learning

> “Today I did the following things:  
> – …  
> – …  
> Help me summarize:  
> 1. What the main things I got done were,  
> 2. What I learned,  
> 3. One thing I could improve for tomorrow.”

### Exercise

Pick one moment (morning / mid‑day / evening) and use AI according to the template **for one day**.  
At the end of the day, ask yourself:
- Did this actually help me?  
- What would I change in the prompt?
