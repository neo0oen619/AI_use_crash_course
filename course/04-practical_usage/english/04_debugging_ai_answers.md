## “Debugging” AI answers – how to fix direction mid‑conversation

The first answer from the AI will not always be good.  
This chapter is about **talking to the AI about its answer** and steering it.

### 1. First notice what bothers you

Before asking for a fix, ask yourself:
- Is the answer too general?  
- Is important information missing?  
- Is it too long or too short?  
- Is the tone off (too cold, too “preachy”, not sensitive enough)?

Once you know what bothers you, it’s easier to ask for a focused change.

### 2. Ask the AI to critique itself

You can say:

> “Your previous answer wasn’t good enough for me.  
> Please review it and write:  
> – what you did well,  
> – what is missing,  
> – what you would change to better match what I asked for.”

Or:

> “Rewrite your answer,  
> and explicitly mark where you are less confident and where I should check other sources.”

This pushes the AI into a more critical mode.

### 3. Add missing context and constraints

Many issues come from prompts that were too short or vague.

You can say:

> “Your answer was [too general / not sensitive enough / not focused on X].  
> What matters to me is: [short explanation].  
> Please try again, but this time:  
> – focus on [topic],  
> – keep it within [number] sentences,  
> – use a [empathetic / neutral / simple] tone.”

The clearer you are, the higher the chance of a good revision.

### 4. Ask for a “Plan B” – a completely different version

Sometimes it’s better not to “patch” the old answer, but to request a new one:

> “Ignore your previous answer,  
> and write a completely new answer  
> based on this updated prompt: [write a clearer prompt here].”

Or:

> “Give me a ‘Plan B’ answer – a very different version,  
> that focuses more on [aspect] and less on [other aspect].”

You can then compare the answers and choose or combine them.

### 5. Ask the AI to ask *you* clarifying questions

Sometimes you just feel “this doesn’t quite fit”, but you don’t know what’s missing.  
Then you can flip the roles:

> “Before you answer, ask me 5 clarifying questions  
> that will help you understand what I really need.  
> Only after I answer them – give me a new answer.”

This helps the AI help you refine the prompt in an intuitive way.

### Short exercise

1. Take a previous AI answer that wasn’t satisfying for you.  
2. Write something like:

> “Treat your previous answer as a draft,  
> and write an improved version based on these instructions:  
> [describe what to emphasize, what to shorten, what tone to use].”

3. Compare the versions:  
   Did self‑critique help? A clearer prompt? A completely new “Plan B” answer?
