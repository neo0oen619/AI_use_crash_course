## Checklist before adopting an AI answer

Before you take an AI answer “as is”, go through this short checklist.

### 1. Does it sound reasonable?

- Are there parts that sound extreme or very unlikely?  
- Are there contradictions inside the answer?

If yes, you can ask:

> “Review your answer and point out where there might be issues or contradictions.”

### 2. Is this a sensitive topic?

- Health, mental health, money, law, children – these are **high‑risk** areas.  
- There you should always seek an additional human source (book, article, professional, etc.).

### 3. Are there critical facts?

- If the answer contains numbers, study names, dates – do **not** assume they are correct.  
- You can ask:

> “Please explicitly mark which parts of this answer require checking against an external source.”

### 4. Does it really fit my situation?

- AI gives a general answer; your situation is specific.  
- Ask yourself:
  - Do I see clearly how this connects to my reality?  
  - Is any important background missing?

### 5. What is the risk if I’m wrong?

- If it’s just an email phrasing – low risk.  
- If it’s a decision with real consequences – high risk.

The higher the risk, the more:
- critical thinking,  
- external sources,  
- and human judgment you need.
