## Module 03 – Practical Everyday Usage

This module shows how AI can fit into your **everyday life** in a simple, practical way:
- Planning your day (work or study).
- Writing and rewriting (emails, messages, summaries).
- Learning with AI as a tutor.
- Checking and improving answers instead of trusting them blindly.

### Episodes in this module (English)

- `01_daily_workflows.md` – how to use AI in the morning, during the day, and at the end of the day. (~10–15 min, beginner)  
- `02_learning_with_ai.md` – using AI as a learning partner and tutor. (~10–15 min, beginner)  
- `03_checklist_before_using_answer.md` – a short checklist before accepting an answer. (~5–10 min, beginner)  
- `04_debugging_ai_answers.md` – how to debug and fix weak or wrong answers. (~15–20 min, intermediate)  
- `05_conversation_templates.md` – templates for structuring a helpful conversation. (~15–20 min, intermediate)  
- `06_language_and_ai.md` – why language matters (Hebrew vs English, quirks, internal thinking). (~15–20 min, intermediate)  
- `07_context_and_history.md` – how long chats, context length and "history" affect the AI. (~15–20 min, intermediate)

### Hebrew content

- The Hebrew episodes are in the `../hebrew/` folder, with `../hebrew/README.md` as a short map.  
- You can move back and forth between Hebrew and English if you are comfortable with both.

Use this README as a map: pick the episode that fits your current need (for example: planning your day, learning, or debugging an answer) and try the suggested prompts directly with an AI model.  
If you later want to work with **agents** and more structured feedback loops, continue to `11_agents` after you feel comfortable with this module.
