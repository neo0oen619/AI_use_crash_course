## Learning a new topic with AI

The idea is to treat AI as a **patient private tutor** who is willing to explain things in different ways.

### Step 1 – Map your current knowledge

> “I want to learn about [topic].  
> Right now my knowledge level is: [I know nothing / I’ve heard a bit / I studied it long ago].  
> Give me a general explanation in about 10 sentences, and then list 5 basic concepts I should know.”

### Step 2 – Deepen one concept

> “Focus on concept number [X].  
> Explain it in more detail, but still in simple language.  
> At the end, suggest 3 short exercises I can do to check if I understood.”

### Step 3 – Explain in your own words

> “I’ll now try to explain to you, in my own words, what I understood about [topic / concept].  
> After I write, please tell me:  
> – what I explained correctly,  
> – what is not accurate,  
> – and what I should clarify.”

Write your explanation, then read the AI’s feedback.

### Step 4 – Save good material

When you get a particularly good explanation:
- save it in a file (for example in `user_add_ideas_videos`),  
- also save the prompts that worked well, so you can reuse them later.
