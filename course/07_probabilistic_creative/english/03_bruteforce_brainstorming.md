## “Brute‑force” idea generation – using it wisely

“Brute‑force” here means generating **many** ideas quickly, without judging them at first.  
The danger is information overload; the goal is more variety, not confusion.

### Step 1 – ask for many ideas

> “Give me 20 ideas for [topic], without judging them yet. Just a short list.”

### Step 2 – group them

> “Now group these 20 ideas into 3–5 clusters by type or theme, and give each cluster a name.”

### Step 3 – pick clusters to focus on

> “Clusters [numbers] look most interesting to me.  
> Please expand only those: explain each idea in 2–3 sentences.”

### Step 4 – set limits

To avoid drowning:
- limit how much time you spend on idea generation,  
- decide in advance how many ideas you will **actually try** (e.g., 2–3).

### Exercise

Choose a personal topic (project, learning, habit) and:
- generate 20 ideas,  
- group them,  
- then choose 2–3 and ask the AI to help you turn them into a simple action plan.
