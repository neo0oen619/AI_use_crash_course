## Filtering ideas and choosing what matters

Once you have many ideas, you need to **filter** them.  
The AI can help propose criteria, but you make the final decisions.

### Example criteria

Ask the AI:

> “Help me filter my ideas using these criteria:  
> – how easy it is to implement (1–5),  
> – how big the potential impact is (1–5),  
> – how well it fits my personality (I’ll describe myself).”

Describe yourself briefly, then ask for a table:

> “Show a table with columns: idea, ease, impact, fit, your recommendation (yes/no/maybe).”

### Keep the last word for yourself

Even if the AI recommends, you decide:
- what feels realistic,  
- what you are motivated to try,  
- what fits your values.

### Exercise

Take a list of ideas you already generated and ask:

> “Help me choose 2–3 ideas to start with, using simple criteria: time, energy, and impact.”

Check whether the suggestions match your own sense of what is right for you.
