## Module 06 – Probabilistic Thinking and “Brute-Force” Ideas

AI does not “know the truth”; it samples from a distribution of possible answers.  
In this module you will learn:
- To think of answers as probabilistic suggestions, not verdicts.
- To ask for multiple answers and compare them.
- To generate many ideas quickly (“brute force”) without drowning.
- To filter and select the ideas that actually fit you.

If you like brainstorming and creative thinking, this module shows how to use AI as a “many-ideas generator” while you stay the one who chooses.
