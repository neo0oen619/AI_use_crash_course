## Asking for multiple answers and choosing between them

Instead of taking the first answer as final, you can ask for **several** and compare.

### A simple pattern

> “Give me 3–5 different options for [answer / idea / wording].  
> Then, briefly say which one you think fits best and why.”

### When this is useful

- When you want better wording (e.g., for an email).  
- When you want several angles on a problem.  
- When you’re not sure what the options even are.

### Example – explaining something

> “Give me 4 different ways to explain what anxiety is, in simple language.  
> After each explanation, say who it might fit (e.g., child, teenager, adult).”

You can pick the one that feels most appropriate, or mix elements from several.

### Exercise

Take a short text you wrote (email, paragraph, explanation) and ask:

> “Give me 3 alternative versions of this text, with different styles (formal, simple, empathic).”

Compare the versions and choose (or combine) what fits you.
