## AI as probability, not absolute truth

### How to think about an answer

When you ask a question:
- the model does not “search its mind for the truth”,  
- it assigns probabilities to many possible next tokens and answers, and then picks one.

You can imagine:
- a box of many possible answers,  
- some are good, some mediocre, some just wrong,  
- the model draws one based on its internal probability distribution.

### Why this matters

- If you ask the **same question twice**, you may get different answers.  
- There is no guarantee that any one answer is “the” answer.  
- It is more like a suggestion than a verdict.

### Exercise

Ask the AI:

> “Explain what a large language model is in three different ways:  
> – one very simple explanation,  
> – one medium‑level,  
> – one slightly more technical.”

Notice:
- how different the explanations are,  
- which one helps you most.
