## Instructor Guide – AI Crash‑Course (1 Day or 2–3 Short Sessions)

This guide is for running the course as a **crash‑course** for a small group (team, students, colleagues) – either in one intensive day or 2–3 shorter sessions.

### Suggested structure – 1 intensive day (about 5–6 hours net)

#### Part 1 – Opening and “what game are we playing?” (~1 hour)

Goal: give a big‑picture feel, basic intuition about AI/LLMs, reduce fear.

- Files:
  - `00_roadmap_syllabus/english/00_overview.md`  
  - `01_intro/english/01_what_is_ai.md`
- Activities:
  - Quick round: what each person already knows/feels about AI.  
  - Live demo of a simple AI chat (basic prompt + improved prompt).

#### Part 2 – Smart everyday usage (~1.5 hours)

Goal: show how AI helps in daily work/study, without heavy tech details.

- Files:
  - `04-practical_usage/english/01_daily_workflows.md`  
  - `04-practical_usage/english/02_learning_with_ai.md`  
  - `04-practical_usage/english/03_checklist_before_using_answer.md`
- Activities:
  - Each participant writes 2–3 situations where AI could help (emails, summaries, learning).  
  - Work in pairs with AI, using one of the templates.  
  - Short sharing: what worked, what surprised them.

#### Part 3 – Prompts and conversation structure (~1.5 hours)

Goal: learn to “speak AI” – prompt structure, conversation templates, debugging.

- Files:
  - `05_prompt_engineering_basic/english/01_intro_to_prompts.md`  
  - `05_prompt_engineering_basic/english/02_conversation_templates.md`  
  - `04-practical_usage/english/04_debugging_ai_answers.md`  
  - `04-practical_usage/english/05_conversation_templates.md`
- Activities:
  - Demo: vague prompt → good prompt → compare answers.  
  - Exercise: each participant builds 2–3 “personal prompts” (beginning of their own library).  
  - Short debugging exercise: take a not‑great answer and improve it together.

#### Part 4 – Language, context and safety (~1 hour)

Goal: understand limitations – language (Hebrew/English), context length, mistakes, ethics.

- Files:
  - `04-practical_usage/english/06_language_and_ai.md`  
  - `04-practical_usage/english/07_context_and_history.md`  
  - `07_quirks_safety/english/01_hallucinations.md` (short)  
  - `08_ethics_privacy/english/01_privacy_basics.md`
- Activities:
  - Demo: same question at start vs at end of a long chat.  
  - Short discussion: when *not* to use AI, and what must always be double‑checked.  
  - Group “golden rules” for responsible use.

#### Part 5 – Small personal project and closing (30–45 minutes)

Goal: each person leaves with something personal and concrete to continue with.

- Files:
  - `09_projects_summary/english/01_personal_project.md`  
  - `10_prompt_library/english/core_prompts.md` (for inspiration).
- Activities:
  - Each participant chooses one area where AI will help them in the next month.  
  - Build 2–3 initial prompts for that area.  
  - Closing round:
    - most surprising thing learned,  
    - first small step they commit to.

### Variation – 2–3 short sessions

If you prefer to split:

- **Session 1 (~2 hours)** – Parts 1 + 2.  
- **Session 2 (~2 hours)** – Parts 3 + 4.  
- **Session 3 (~1–2 hours)** – personal projects + reinforcing “golden rules”.

The facilitator can choose extra reading between sessions (e.g., selected parts of modules 05–06 for more advanced participants).
