## Module 11 – Agents and Deeper AI Workflows

This module introduces **AI agents**:
- what an agent is compared to a normal WebUI chat,
- how to work with one agent that thinks from several perspectives,
- when it still makes sense to define several simple agents with clear roles,
- and how all of this connects (in a small, careful way) to the idea of AGI.

### Files in this module

- `../hebrew/01_agents_intro_and_practice.md` – full lesson in Hebrew about agents, multi‑perspective reasoning, .md workflows, runtime today and future directions. (~20–30 min, intermediate)  
- `../hebrew/02_feedback_loops_and_refinement.md` – lesson about feedback loops, error‑correction sessions, “judge” roles, prompt‑engineering roles, and how wording/jail‑breaking interact with safety and quality. (~20–30 min, intermediate/advanced)

If you are comfortable with Hebrew, read the Hebrew lessons directly.  
If you prefer English, you can skim this README as a high‑level map and ask your AI assistant to summarize or translate specific Hebrew sections when needed.
