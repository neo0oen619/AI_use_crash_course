## Conversation templates for starting well with AI

The goal is to avoid reinventing your prompt every time, and instead use a few **reusable templates**.

Core pattern:

> Who I am → what the problem is → what I already tried → what I need now.

### Template 1 – General problem solving

> “I am [brief description of you].  
> I’m trying to understand/solve [short description of the problem].  
> I already tried:  
> – …  
> – …  
> Now I need you to help me with [exactly what: ideas, structure, explanation, practice].”

### Template 2 – Improving a text

> “The following text is a [type: email, summary, post, etc.].  
> The audience is [who it’s for].  
> It’s important to keep the style [formal / simple / empathic].  
> Please improve the text so it’s shorter and clearer, without changing the main message.”  
>  
> *Paste the text here…*

### Template 3 – Brainstorming

> “I’m looking for ideas for [topic].  
> Give me at least 10 different ideas, both simple and creative.  
> For each idea, write one sentence to describe it and one sentence with its main advantage.”

Then you can ask:

> “Now help me choose 2–3 ideas to start with.”

### Template 4 – Long learning conversation with summaries

> “I want to learn a topic with you step by step.  
> Every time I write ‘summary please’, summarize what we’ve covered so far in 5 bullet points.  
> If the conversation gets very long, remind me that we might want to open a new chat with a short summary.”

### Exercise

Pick one template:
- copy it into a personal file,  
- adapt it to your world (study / work / project),  
- use it 3–4 times this week.

After a few uses, update the template so it fits you even better.
