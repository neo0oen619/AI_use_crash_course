## What is prompt engineering?

### The idea

The AI responds to the text you write – that text is the **prompt**.  
The clearer the prompt, the higher the chance of a good answer.

Prompt engineering is the skill of **writing good prompts**.

### Four parts of a good prompt

1. **Role of the AI**  
   Who do you want it to “be”?
   > “You are a writing assistant who explains in simple English.”  
   > “You are a thinking partner who helps me organize ideas.”

2. **The task**  
   What exactly should it do? Summarize, rewrite, suggest ideas, critique a text, etc.

3. **The context**  
   A few sentences about who this is for, what the situation is, what matters.

4. **The answer format**  
   Bullet points? Short paragraphs? A table? Maximum length?

### Example

> “You are a writing assistant in simple English.  
> I need a short summary of a meeting with a person who feels social anxiety.  
> Please give me a 5‑bullet summary in a gentle, non‑judgmental tone.”

### Exercise

Write to the AI:

> “You are a patient tutor.  
> I’m new to working with AI and want to understand the basics.  
> Explain briefly what a large language model is, and give one everyday example.  
> Answer in up to 10 sentences, in simple language.”

Then change one part of the prompt (role / task / context / format) each time and see how the answers change.
