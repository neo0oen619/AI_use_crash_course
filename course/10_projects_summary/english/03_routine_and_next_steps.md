## Daily/weekly routine and next steps

The course is only the beginning.  
To turn it into a habit, it helps to design a simple routine.

### Daily routine idea

- **5 minutes in the morning** – quick planning with AI (what is important today).  
- **10–15 minutes sometime in the day** – use AI for one task (summarize, draft, learn).  
- **5 minutes at the end of the day** – short reflection with AI (what happened, what you learned).

### Weekly routine idea

Once a week:
- open one module and revisit one idea,  
- try a new or improved prompt,  
- update your personal notes (e.g., in `user_add_ideas_videos`) with what you learned.

### Continuing to learn

- Choose a topic for deeper learning (e.g., models, prompt engineering, ethics).  
- Look for external resources (books, articles, videos),  
- and use AI to summarize and explain them.

The goal is not to know every technical detail, but to feel **comfortable and confident** using AI as a tool in your real life and work.
