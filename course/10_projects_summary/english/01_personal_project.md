## Personal project – AI that actually helps you

The goal is to choose **one real area** where AI can make your life easier, and build a small, practical project around it.

### Step 1 – Choose an area

Ask yourself:
- Where do I spend a lot of time writing / summarizing / organizing?  
- Where do I feel overloaded and could use help?

Examples:
- summarizing meetings or sessions,  
- organizing study notes,  
- writing recurring emails,  
- summarizing busy work days.

### Step 2 – Define success

Write:

> “I want to use AI to help me with [area].  
> It will be a success if: [how I’ll know it works].”

Be specific but simple – for example, “I spend 30% less time on X” or “I feel less confused about Y at the end of the day.”

### Step 3 – Build 2–3 prompts for this project

Based on earlier modules (03–04–05), create:
- one prompt to **start** (e.g., planning, describing the situation),  
- one prompt to **work** (e.g., summarizing, drafting),  
- one prompt to **wrap up** (e.g., reflection, next steps).

Save them in a file (for example `user_add_ideas_videos/my_project_prompts.md`).

### Step 4 – Try it for 1–2 weeks

Decide:
- when you will use it (e.g., after every meeting, or at the end of each work day),  
- how you will check if it helps (time saved, clarity, reduced stress).

After 1–2 weeks, write a short reflection:
- What worked well?  
- What didn’t?  
- How should you change your prompts or routine?
