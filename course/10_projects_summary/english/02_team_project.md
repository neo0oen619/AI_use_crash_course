## Small team project (if you learn with others)

If you are a few people learning this course together, you can build a shared project.

### Basic idea

1. Choose a common topic (for example: “Using AI for learning”, or “Using AI to improve communication in our team”).  
2. Build together a small **prompt toolkit** – a set of useful prompts for that topic.  
3. Try them over some time.  
4. Share what worked and what didn’t.

### Possible division of roles

- One person focuses on prompts for learning.  
- One on prompts for writing and editing.  
- One on prompts for daily planning.  
- etc.

You can collect everything into a shared file (for example `user_add_ideas_videos/team_prompts.md`).
