## Self-check – What can I do with AI now?

Before you continue on your own, it helps to see what skills you’ve already built.

Tick what feels true for you right now:

- [ ] I can write a basic, structured prompt (context, goal, what matters to me).  
- [ ] I can ask for several options/versions and not rely on a single answer.  
- [ ] I can notice a suspicious answer and ask the AI about its limitations.  
- [ ] I have at least one area where AI helps me regularly (study / work / personal project).  
- [ ] I have a small daily/weekly habit with AI that feels helpful rather than overwhelming.

Add your own items if you want:

- [ ] ______________________________________  
- [ ] ______________________________________

Then write 2–3 short sentences:

1. Where has AI helped me the most so far?  
2. What do I want to improve in the way I work with it?  
3. What do I *not* want to give up (my judgment, boundaries, rest time, etc.)?

You can paste your answers into a chat with an AI model and ask it to help you design a personal “next steps” plan.
