## Module 09 – Personal Projects and Summary

This final module ties everything together:
- You choose one real area in your life where AI can help.
- You design a small personal project (and optionally a team project).
- You create a daily/weekly routine for using AI.
- You reflect on what you’ve learned and what to improve next.
