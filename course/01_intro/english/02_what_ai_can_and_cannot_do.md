## What AI is good at – and what it is not

### Things it is good at

- **Summarizing text** – articles, chapters, meeting notes.  
- **Rewriting** – turning complex text into something clearer and simpler.  
- **Generating ideas** – directions for thinking, examples, questions to ask.  
- **Drafting** – emails, posts, short reports, outlines.  
- **Helping with learning** – explaining concepts, suggesting exercises, checking understanding.

### Things it is weak at

- **Exact, up‑to‑date facts** – it can be wrong about details (dates, numbers, studies).  
- **Full context** – it sees only what you write, not your whole situation or life.  
- **Value and moral judgment** – it does not truly “feel” good/bad; it imitates text.  
- **Responsibility** – it does not hold responsibility for decisions; you do.

### How to think about it

It is helpful to see AI as:
- a **writing and thinking assistant**,  
- a **generator of suggestions**,  
- a kind of **patient private tutor**,

and not as:
- “the absolute truth”,  
- or “a replacement for professionals”.

### Exercise

Ask the AI:

> “Give me a list of 5 things you are good at, and 5 things you are weak at, when people use you for learning and writing.”

Compare its list to what you read here.
