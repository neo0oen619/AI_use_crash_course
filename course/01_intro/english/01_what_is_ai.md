## What is AI and what is a language model?

### Simple intuition

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a general name for tools that try to do things we usually call “smart”:
- understand text,
- answer questions,
- write and explain,
- analyze information.

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a specific kind of AI that has read huge amounts of text and learned to predict the next token (piece of text).

It does not “understand” like a human, but:
- it sees patterns in language,
- and can imitate styles, structures, and explanations.

### Why does this matter for you?

- Our world is full of text: emails, meeting notes, articles, messages, reports, academic work, etc.
- A language model can help you:
  - write faster,
  - summarize material,
  - generate ideas,
  - and organize your thinking.
- It does **not** replace human responsibility, judgment, or expertise.

### Quick exercise

Open an AI chat and write:

> “Explain briefly, in very simple English, what a large language model (LLM) is, as if I know nothing about computers.”

Notice:
- Is the explanation clear to you?
- What would you explain differently to a friend?
