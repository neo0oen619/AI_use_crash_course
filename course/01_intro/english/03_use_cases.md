## Everyday practical use cases with AI

Here are a few situations where AI can help in daily life, work, and study.

### 1. Summarizing a meeting

After a meeting (work, project, research, supervision, etc.):

> “Here are my rough notes from the meeting.  
> Please turn them into a clear, short summary in 5–7 bullet points.”

### 2. Writing an email or message

When it is hard to phrase something:

> “I need to write an email/message to [who].  
> The goal is [what].  
> Here are my main points:  
> – …  
> – …  
> Please turn this into a polite, clear email.”

### 3. Simple explanation of a concept

> “Explain in simple English what [concept] means, as if I’m explaining it to a friend with no background in this field.”

You can use this for concepts from psychology, medicine, or any area.

### 4. Organizing a work/study day

> “I have about [X] free hours today.  
> I need to do: [list of tasks].  
> Help me build a reasonable schedule, and mark where you as an AI could help me (summarizing, drafting, etc.).”

### 5. Learning from experience

At the end of a day:

> “I’ll tell you briefly what I did today and what felt good/not so good.  
> Then, please help me summarize:  
> – what went well,  
> – what I could improve,  
> – and one small change idea for tomorrow.”

### Exercise

Pick **two** use cases from this list and try them this week.  
After a few days, ask yourself:
- What genuinely helped?  
- What helped less?  
- Which prompts would you like to save and reuse?
