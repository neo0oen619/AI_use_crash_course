## Myths and common fears about AI

### “AI will replace me”

Reality:
- It is good at writing, summarizing, and organizing information.  
- It does not meet people, does not hold responsibility, and does not replace human judgment.  
- It shifts the nature of work: less technical typing, more thinking, human connection, and decision‑making.

### “You can’t trust it at all”

Reality:
- There are areas where it is very strong (summaries, wording, generating ideas).  
- Used with care and a simple checklist, it can give you a lot of value.  
- The goal is **smart use**, not blind trust and not panic.

### “I’m not good enough with technology”

- To start, all you need is:
  - a browser,  
  - ability to type,  
  - copy/paste.  
- The rest is a skill that grows slowly through practice.

### Conversation exercise

Write to the AI:

> “I’m a bit afraid of AI.  
> Please help me understand how to use you in a safe way, without giving up my own judgment.”

Notice:
- What advice does it give?  
- Which parts feel right for you?  
- What “personal rules” would you add for yourself?
