## Big‑Picture Overview – How This Course Works

### Who is this course for?

- People who are curious about AI and want to use it in real life.
- Researchers / students (including psychology, health, social sciences, etc.) who want AI as a thinking and writing partner.
- Anyone who is not “techy”, but is willing to read, try, and learn step‑by‑step.

No programming background is required.

### What will you learn?

- What large language models (LLMs) are and what they are not.
- How to use AI as a helper for:
  - writing and rewriting texts,
  - summarizing information,
  - generating ideas and organizing your thoughts.
- How to write good prompts (questions / instructions) so the answers are clearer and more useful.
- Core concepts like: context window, tokens, truncation, safety layers, and hallucinations (invented facts).
- How to use AI in a responsible way, without giving up your own judgment.

### How to use this repo

1. **Read gradually**  
   Go through the modules in order – from `00` to `09`.  
   Each module has:
   - a short explanation,
   - simple examples,
   - small exercises to try with an AI chat.

2. **Learn with AI, not only about AI**  
   When you see an exercise, open your preferred AI (e.g., ChatGPT / Copilot) and:
   - paste the suggested prompt,
   - adapt it to your own field or interests,
   - notice how small changes in wording change the answers.

3. **Use the `user_add_ideas_videos` folder as your personal add‑on pack**  
   In `user_add_ideas_videos` you (the human user) can put:
   - links to useful videos (e.g., YouTube),
   - notes and ideas from your own work / research,
   - prompts that worked well for you.

   When you add something important, it’s useful to:
   - create a file like `notes_YYYY_MM_DD.md` or topic files like `psychology_prompts.md`, `learning_ideas.md`,
   - link to them from the relevant module (for example, from `05_prompt_engineering_basic`).

### Short roadmap (where to go first)

- **Module 01 – Intro**  
  Get an intuitive feel: what AI/LLMs are, and what they can and cannot do.

- **Module 02 – How models and context work**  
  Understand, without heavy math, what “tokens” are, what a context window is, and what happens in a long conversation.

- **Module 03 – Practical usage**  
  Start using AI for daily tasks: summaries, emails, explanations, and organizing your day.

- **Modules 04–05 – Prompt engineering**  
  Learn how to write better prompts and use templates for conversations, including a bit of psychology‑flavored examples.

- **Module 06 – Probabilistic / brute‑force thinking**  
  Learn to ask for multiple answers, generate many ideas, and then filter them.

- **Module 07 – Quirks and safety**  
  Understand hallucinations, biases, safety layers, and why long conversations can become strange at the edges.

- **Module 08 – Ethics and privacy**  
  Learn simple principles for using AI safely with sensitive topics.

- **Module 09 – Projects and routines**  
  Build your own “AI helper” workflow that fits your life and work, and create habits around it.
