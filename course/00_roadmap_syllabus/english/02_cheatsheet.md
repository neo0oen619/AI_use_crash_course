## Quick Cheatsheet – Start Using AI Fast

If you want to start using AI right now, without reading everything, use this page.

### 1. 10‑second conversation opener

Copy, paste, and adjust:

> “You are a helpful assistant who explains things in simple English.  
> I am new to working with AI and I want to understand [topic].  
> Please explain briefly, without technical jargon, and give one everyday example.”

Change `[topic]` to anything you like.

### 2. Four “golden questions” to ask AI

1. “Explain it to me as if I’m a beginner.”  
2. “Give me a simple example.”  
3. “Give me an example from a field I care about (for example psychology / research / daily life).”  
4. “Check if your explanation really matches my question, and if not – correct yourself.”

Using these four requests already makes most answers much clearer.

### 3. How to say “this isn’t good enough” (politely)

You can talk to the AI like this:

- “This was too technical.”  
- “This was too long / too short.”  
- “You are missing my main point.”  

Then add:

> “Please try again, but this time… [what you want to change].”

Example:

> “Please try again, but this time write no more than 8 sentences, with no technical terms, as if you explain it to a friend.”

### 4. Template for asking for multiple examples

> “Give me 3 examples:  
> 1. A very simple example.  
> 2. A medium‑level example.  
> 3. A more challenging example.”

You can use this pattern for almost any topic.

### 5. If you feel confused – ask for a new summary

Just write:

> “I’m confused. Please summarize the main idea again in 5 short bullet points.”

Or:

> “Give me one sentence that summarizes everything you said so far.”

### 6. Minimal learning path in this repo

If you have limited time and want the “core” path:

1. Read this file and `00_overview.md` (in this folder).  
2. Then open `01_intro/hebrew` or `01_intro/english` (once that exists) and read the basic “What is AI?” file.  
3. Read `03_models_context/hebrew` or `03_models_context/english` on tokens and context windows.  
4. Read `05_prompt_engineering_basic/.../02_conversation_templates.md` to get conversation templates.  

After that, you can already use AI as a tool and learn the rest gradually, using the AI itself to explain any concept you don’t understand.
