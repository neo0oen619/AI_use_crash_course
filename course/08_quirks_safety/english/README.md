## Module 07 – Quirks, Failures and Safety

This module focuses on the “messy” side of working with AI:
- When and how it makes things up (hallucinations).
- What kinds of biases and knowledge limits it can have.
- How safety and censorship layers work – and where they fail.
- Why very long conversations can behave strangely.

Use this module to build a “healthy skepticism” when working with AI: not fear, but awareness.
