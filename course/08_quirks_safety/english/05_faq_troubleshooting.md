## FAQ / Troubleshooting – common quirks and what to try

### 1. "The AI sounds very sure – but I’m not sure it’s right"

Reality:
- confident tone ≠ correct content.  
- formatting and style can hide mistakes.

**Try this:**

> "Answer the question, but at the end of your answer:  
> - list 2–3 parts that might be wrong or uncertain,  
> - and say what I should double-check in other sources."

Then, for anything important, verify with books, articles, or colleagues.

### 2. "I got a huge wall of text"

Sometimes the model gives long, dense answers that are hard to use.

**Try this:**

> "Please rewrite your answer as:  
> - 5–7 bullet points,  
> - with short sentences,  
> - and a one-line summary at the top."

You can also ask:

> "Highlight in bold the 2 most important points for me to focus on."

### 3. "It forgot things I said earlier"

Long chats can push early messages out of the context window.

**Try this:**

1. Write a short summary: 3–5 key points from the beginning.  
2. Start a new chat and paste only that summary.  
3. Ask:

> "Based on this summary, help me continue the work on this topic."

### 4. "It refused to answer something that feels harmless"

Safety layers sometimes over‑react and block legitimate questions.

**Try this:**

> "I am not asking for advice on harming anyone or doing anything illegal.  
> I only want general information about [topic].  
> Please answer at a high level, and say clearly if there is anything you cannot or should not answer."

If it still refuses, that’s a good moment to pause and ask yourself whether a human expert or a different resource would be better.

### 5. "The conversation feels stuck or messy"

You’ve tried to refine the answer, but things only get more confusing.

**Try this:**

> "Please summarize in 5 bullet points what you think we are working on, and what you think I want from you."

If the summary is far from what you meant:
- write your own short version,  
- start a new chat with that version,  
- and continue from there.
