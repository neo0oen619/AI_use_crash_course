## Psychological pitfalls when working with AI

Here we focus on **our** reactions to AI, not only on how it works.

### Anthropomorphism – treating AI like a person

It is very easy to feel that the AI:
- “understands” you,  
- “empathizes” with you,  
- “thinks” like you.

In reality:
- it operates on text patterns,  
- it has no inner experience, feelings, or awareness.

You can use the conversational feeling, but keep this limitation in mind.

### Illusion of accuracy

Confidence in tone ≠ correctness of content.

- A well‑structured, confident answer can still be wrong.  
- Formatting and style can create a false sense of certainty.

### Over‑reliance

Because it is convenient, you might:
- ask it about everything,  
- stop thinking on your own before asking.

Try to:
- think for a moment first: “What do I already think?”  
- use AI to **extend** your thinking, not replace it.

### Exercise

Ask the AI:

> “Help me write 5 simple personal rules for using you without giving up my own judgment.”

Save the rules that feel right for you and refer to them from time to time.
