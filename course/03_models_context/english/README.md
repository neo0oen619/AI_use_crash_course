## Module 02 – How Models, Tokens and Context Work

In this module you will learn:
- How large language models learn to "continue text".
- What tokens and the context window are.
- What happens in long conversations (truncation / forgetting).
- How roles and configuration affect the model's behavior.

### Episodes in this module

Hebrew (`../hebrew/` folder):
- `../hebrew/README.md` – general description of the module (Hebrew).  
- `../hebrew/01_how_llms_work.md` – how an LLM learns to predict the next token. (~10–15 min, beginner)  
- `../hebrew/02_tokens_and_context.md` – tokens, context length and context window. (~10–15 min, beginner)  
- `../hebrew/03_truncation_and_long_dialogues.md` – what happens when the conversation is too long. (~10–15 min, beginner)  
- `../hebrew/04_position_and_roles.md` – System / User / Assistant roles and their effect. (~10–15 min, beginner)  
- `../hebrew/05_model_size_and_config.md` – model size and configuration (temperature, max_tokens) in intuitive terms. (~10–15 min, intermediate)  
- `../hebrew/06_safety_and_training_gaps.md` – safety layers, training gaps, and issues in very long conversations. (~10–15 min, intermediate)

English (this folder):
- `01_how_llms_work.md` – an intuitive explanation of how LLMs work. (~10–15 min, beginner)  
- `02_tokens_and_context.md` – tokens, context length, and context window in plain language. (~10–15 min, beginner)  
- `03_truncation_and_long_dialogues.md` – what happens when a conversation becomes too long. (~10–15 min, beginner)  
- `04_position_and_roles.md` – how System / User / Assistant roles and instructions change behavior. (~10–15 min, beginner)  
- `05_model_size_and_config.md` – model size, temperature and other knobs, without heavy math. (~10–15 min, intermediate)  
- `06_safety_and_training_gaps.md` – safety layers and training gaps, especially in very long conversations. (~10–15 min, intermediate)

Use this README as a map: pick one episode, read it in English, and (if you also read Hebrew) compare it with the matching Hebrew file to deepen your understanding.
