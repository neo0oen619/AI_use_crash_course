## Study Tips & Mindset – Learning *with* AI, Not Just *About* AI

This page is optional, but it can make your learning smoother and more fun.

## 1. Keep a tiny “AI lab notebook”

You don’t need anything fancy. A simple document or notebook is enough.

Use it to jot down:
- prompts that worked well,
- mistakes or “weird answers” you saw,
- ideas for how AI could help you in your own life/work.

You can store your notes in:
- a local file (e.g., `user_add_ideas_videos/my_prompts.md`), or  
- any note‑taking tool you like.

The goal is to **notice patterns**, not to document everything.

## 2. Talk to AI about what you’re learning

As you read the course files, you can:

- Ask for **simple re‑explanations**:  
  > “Explain this section again in 5 bullet points.”  
  > “Explain this as if I’m 15 years old.”  

- Ask for **examples in your domain**:  
  > “Give me 3 examples of how someone in psychology / social sciences might use this idea.”  

- Ask for **mini‑quizzes**:  
  > “Ask me 5 questions to check if I understood this section, then give me feedback.”

This turns the course into an *interactive* experience.

## 3. What to do when you feel overwhelmed or stuck

It’s normal to feel:
- “There’s too much content,” or  
- “I still don’t fully ‘get it’.”

When that happens:

1. **Zoom out**  
   > “Summarize what you think I’ve been learning so far, in 5–7 bullet points.”  
   Check if the model’s summary matches your feeling.

2. **Ask for a “GPS”**  
   > “Given what I’ve read so far, what would you recommend I do next in this course?”  

3. **Take a break**  
   Sometimes the best move is to **sleep on it** and come back with fresh eyes.

## 4. Use AI as a mirror for your own thinking

Instead of only asking for information, try:

> “Here is how I currently understand ‘tokens’ / ‘context window’ / ‘agents’.  
> Point out where my understanding seems shaky or incomplete.”

Or:

> “I’ll describe my current workflow for [writing / research / study].  
> Suggest 3 places where AI could help, and 3 places where I should *not* use AI.”

This way you use AI to **organize and reflect** on your thinking, not to replace it.

## 5. A healthy mindset: AI as a partner, not a judge

Try to keep these ideas in mind:

- AI is **not** an authority or a judge of your worth.  
- It’s a **tool for thinking** – sometimes brilliant, sometimes very wrong.  
- You are in charge of:
  - choosing what to work on,  
  - checking important facts,  
  - deciding what fits your values and ethics.

If a conversation with AI feels frustrating:
- pause,  
- rewrite your prompt more calmly,  
- or come back another day.

Some of the best ideas arrive *after* a good night’s sleep.
