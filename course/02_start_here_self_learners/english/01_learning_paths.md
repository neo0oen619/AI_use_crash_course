## Start Here – Choose Your Learning Path

This page helps you pick **how** to go through the course.

There is no single right way.  
Choose the path that fits your reality right now:

- ⏱️ **Path A – 90‑minute crash**  
- **Path B – 1‑day intensive**  
- **Path C – 2–3‑week self‑study**

Before you choose, one important rule:

> **Always keep your AI assistant open while learning.**  
> This course is designed to be used *with* AI, not just *about* AI.

---

## Quick decision guide

- **“I have ~90 minutes and just want to understand what this is about.”**  
  → Start with **Path A – 90‑minute crash**.

- **“I’m running / attending a one‑day workshop.”**  
  → Use **Path B – 1‑day intensive** as your schedule.

- **“I really want to change how I work / study and can invest a bit each day.”**  
  → Follow **Path C – 2–3‑week self‑study**.

You can always come back and switch paths later.

---

## Path A – 90‑minute crash

**Goal:** get a simple mental model of AI + a few useful workflows.  
**Total time:** ~60–90 minutes.

### Step A1 – Big‑picture overview (~10–15 min)

Open:

- `course/00_roadmap_syllabus/english/00_overview.md`

Focus on:
- Who this course is for.  
- What you will learn.  
- Rough structure of the modules.

You don’t need to remember everything – just get the *shape* of the course.

---

### Step A2 – What AI is (and isn’t) (~20–25 min)

Open:

- `course/01_intro/english/01_what_is_ai.md`  
- `course/01_intro/english/02_what_ai_can_and_cannot_do.md`

While reading, try one or two questions in your AI tool, for example:

> “In simple language, explain what a large language model is,  
> as if you’re talking to a student in psychology / social sciences.”

> “Give me 3 real‑life examples of how a researcher or student might use AI  
> without replacing critical thinking.”

---

### Step A3 – See AI in your daily life (~20–25 min)

Open:

- `course/04-practical_usage/english/01_daily_workflows.md`  
- `course/04-practical_usage/english/02_learning_with_ai.md` (optional if time is short)

Pick **one** idea that feels realistic for you (e.g., email drafting, planning your day, learning a topic) and actually do it with your AI tool.

---

### Step A4 – Minimal safety checklist (~10–15 min)

Open:

- `course/04-practical_usage/english/03_checklist_before_using_answer.md`  
- If you have time: `course/07_quirks_safety/english/01_hallucinations.md`

Goal:

- Understand that AI sometimes **makes things up**.  
- Learn 2–3 quick checks before trusting an answer.

> After Path A, you should be able to:  
> – Describe roughly what AI can and cannot do.  
> – Use AI for at least one small personal task.  
> – Know that you must **check** important answers.

---

## Path B – 1‑day intensive

**Goal:** by the end of the day you can safely use AI for real work / study,  
and you know where to go deeper.

Think of this as 3 blocks. Each block can be ~1.5–2 hours (with breaks).

---

### Morning block – Foundations (~1.5–2 h)

1. **Big picture refresher (~10–15 min)**  
   - `course/00_roadmap_syllabus/english/00_overview.md`

2. **Intro to AI (~30–40 min)**  
   - `course/01_intro/english/01_what_is_ai.md`  
   - `course/01_intro/english/02_what_ai_can_and_cannot_do.md`  
   - Skim `course/01_intro/english/03_use_cases.md` to get ideas.

3. **How models work (~30–40 min)**  
   - `course/03_models_context/english/01_how_llms_work.md`  
   - `course/03_models_context/english/02_tokens_and_context.md`  
   - `course/03_models_context/english/03_truncation_and_long_dialogues.md` (optional)

During this block, keep asking the AI to re‑explain in your own words:

> “Explain ‘tokens’ again, but using analogies and examples from psychology / research.”

---

### Midday block – Practical usage & prompt basics (~1.5–2 h)

1. **Daily workflows (~30–40 min)**  
   - `course/04-practical_usage/english/01_daily_workflows.md`  
   - `course/04-practical_usage/english/05_conversation_templates.md`

   Try at least one full micro‑workflow (e.g., planning your day, writing an email).

2. **Learning with AI (~20–30 min)**  
   - `course/04-practical_usage/english/02_learning_with_ai.md`  
   - `course/04-practical_usage/english/07_context_and_history.md` (optional)

3. **Prompt basics (~30–40 min)**  
   - `course/05_prompt_engineering_basic/english/01_intro_to_prompts.md`  
   - `course/05_prompt_engineering_basic/english/02_conversation_templates.md`

Ask the AI tool to act as your “prompt coach”:

> “Here is my prompt: ‘Help me write an email to my supervisor.’  
> Suggest how to rewrite it to be clearer and more specific.”

---

### Afternoon block – Language, context, safety (~1.5–2 h)

1. **Quirks & safety (~30–40 min)**  
   - `course/07_quirks_safety/english/01_hallucinations.md`  
   - `course/07_quirks_safety/english/02_biases_and_limits.md`  
   - Skim `course/07_quirks_safety/english/04_psychological_pitfalls.md` if relevant.

2. **Ethics & privacy (~30–40 min)**  
   - `course/08_ethics_privacy/english/01_privacy_basics.md`  
   - `course/08_ethics_privacy/english/02_sensitive_use_cases.md`  
   - `course/08_ethics_privacy/english/04_guidelines_checklist.md`

3. **Wrap‑up: routine and next steps (~20–30 min)**  
   - `course/09_projects_summary/english/03_routine_and_next_steps.md`  
   - `course/09_projects_summary/english/04_self_check.md`

> After Path B, you should:  
> – Have 2–3 concrete workflows where AI helps you.  
> – Know the main risks and a few safety habits.  
> – Have a simple plan for how you’ll keep using AI next week.

---

## Path C – 2–3‑week self‑study

**Goal:** slowly build durable habits and understanding,  
touching almost every major module.

Suggested rhythm: **3–5 short sessions per week**, ~30–60 minutes each.  
You can adjust freely. This is a suggestion, not homework.

---

## Before you start – tiny checklist

- [ ] I have access to an AI assistant (e.g., ChatGPT) and can open it in a tab.  
- [ ] I’ve chosen which path I’m starting with (A, B, or C).  
- [ ] I understand that AI can make mistakes and I’m responsible for checking important answers.  
- [ ] I have somewhere to take quick notes (paper, document, or notes app).

---

## If you prefer Hebrew

Everything above refers to the **English** file paths.  
If you prefer Hebrew:

- Use the same module numbers, but open the files under `hebrew/` or `hebrew_refined/`.  
- The logic of the paths is the same (foundations → practice → safety → projects).

---

## If you’re an instructor

If you’re planning to **teach** this material:

- Use this file to choose the **structure of the day / course** (1‑day vs multi‑week).  
- Then read the **Instructor Guide**:  
  `course/instructor_guide/english/README.md`

There you’ll find tips on:
- pacing,  
- group exercises,  
- common questions and pitfalls.
