## Prompt Library - English

Here are several groups of prompts.  
They are meant as **starting points** – always adapt them to your own context.  
When you see placeholders like `[topic]` or `[problem]`, replace them with your own situation.  
You can save your favorite, customized prompts in `user_add_ideas_videos` so you can reuse them later.
