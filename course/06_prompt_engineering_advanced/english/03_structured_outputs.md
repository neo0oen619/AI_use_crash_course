## Getting structured outputs – lists, tables, and forms

If you ask open questions, you often get free‑form answers.  
When you **define a structure**, it becomes much easier to read and use the response.

### Example – structured list

> “Give me 5 ideas for [topic].  
> For each idea, include:  
> – a short name,  
> – one‑sentence description,  
> – who it is especially suitable for,  
> – the main downside.”

### Example – simple text table

> “Present the ideas in a text table with columns:  
> | Idea | Short description | Suitable for | Main downside |”

Even if you don’t use a spreadsheet, this kind of structure can make answers easier to scan.

### Example – “form” template

> “Create a template I can fill in after a meeting:  
> – Date:  
> – General topic:  
> – Main points:  
> – What went well:  
> – What I’d like to change next time:  
> Don’t fill it in, just give me the template.”

Later you can paste a filled template and ask:

> “Here is a filled form. Please summarize it in 5 key points.”

### Exercise

Pick one structure (list / table / form) and:
- design a template for one type of task in your life,  
- save it in your own notes,  
- use it twice and compare with unstructured answers.
