## Module 05 – Advanced Prompt Engineering

This module builds on Module 04 and goes one step further:
- Creating personas for the AI (role + style).
- Designing multi-step prompts as processes, not just single questions.
- Asking for structured outputs (lists, forms, tables).
- Using a few light examples from psychology.

Pick one area in your life/work and create:
- one AI persona, and  
- 2–3 reusable prompts that you can keep in a personal file and reuse.

If you want to go further into **agents**, Worker/Judge roles, and structured feedback loops on top of these skills, see also Module `11_agents`, which extends the ideas from this module into agent-based workflows.
