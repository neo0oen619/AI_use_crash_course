## Defining an AI persona and style

Instead of talking to a “generic AI”, you can define who it is and how it should answer.

### Why define a persona?

- You get more **consistent** answers.  
- The style fits your audience better (professional / simple / empathic / direct).  
- You don’t have to repeat the same instructions every time.

### Basic persona template

> “You are a [role] who writes in a [style].  
> Your audience is [who].  
> It is important that you always [values / constraints].”

Examples:

- “You are a writing assistant in simple English. Your audience is people with no technical background. It is important that you keep a gentle, non‑judgmental tone.”  
- “You are a thinking partner who helps me structure ideas. Your answers are direct and to the point.”

### Combining persona + task

After defining the persona, add your task, for example:

> “You are a writing assistant in simple English…  
> Now I need you to help me summarize the following notes in 5 bullet points.”

### Exercise

1. Choose one persona that fits you (for example: “patient tutor”, “writing assistant”, “thinking partner”).  
2. Write a persona prompt using the template above.  
3. Save it in a personal file so you can reuse it.  
4. Use it at the start of a few chats and see if the answers feel more “like you want”.
