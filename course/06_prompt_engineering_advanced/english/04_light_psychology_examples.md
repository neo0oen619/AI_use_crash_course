## A few light psychology‑flavored examples

These are meant as **learning and reflection tools**, not as therapy or diagnosis.

### Example 1 – Explaining a psychological concept

> “You are a writing assistant in simple English.  
> Explain briefly what a ‘cognitive distortion’ is, as if to someone with no psychology background.  
> Keep the tone gentle, not judgmental, and give one everyday example.”

### Example 2 – Organizing thoughts after a challenging conversation

> “I want to summarize a conversation I had with someone who is going through emotional difficulty (no identifying details).  
> Please create a template for me to fill in later, with:  
> – what came up in the conversation,  
> – what I think went well,  
> – what I’d like to check or try differently next time.  
> Don’t give advice; just help me structure my thoughts.”

### Example 3 – Self‑reflection ideas

> “Give me 5 ideas for self‑reflection at the end of a busy work day (not therapy, just awareness):  
> – for each idea, explain what to do in practice and who it might fit.”

If you want to develop more prompts like this, you can collect them in your own file (for example `user_add_ideas_videos/psychology_prompts.md`) and refine them over time.
