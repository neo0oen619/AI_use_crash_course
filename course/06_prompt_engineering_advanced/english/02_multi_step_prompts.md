## Multi‑step prompts – building a process

Some tasks are too complex for one single prompt.  
Instead of asking for everything at once, you can break the task into steps and guide the AI through a process.

### General structure for a process

1. Step 1 – clarify the problem and sharpen the goal.  
2. Step 2 – generate ideas or options.  
3. Step 3 – choose / filter together.  
4. Step 4 – deepen and implement the chosen option.

### Example – designing a short lesson or talk

Step 1 – define the goal:

> “I want to design a short session about [topic].  
> First, help me define:  
> – the main goal,  
> – 3 key points I want people to leave with.”

Step 2 – generate content ideas:

> “Based on that, suggest 5 ways to present this (discussion, examples, exercises, stories, etc.).”

Step 3 – filter:

> “I think options [numbers] fit best.  
> Help me refine them into a plan for a 30–45 minute session.”

Step 4 – deepen:

> “Now write a first draft of a summary/script for the session, in the style we defined earlier.”

### Exercise

Think of a real task (writing, planning, organizing).  
Design a 3–4 step process for it, and run each step as a separate prompt with the AI.  
Notice how the quality improves when you slow down and guide the process.
